# INVisum_front

## Welcome to the in visum frontend code homepage.

In Visum is a data sharing platform that focuses not only in the data, but also on the community around it.

This repository is only for the frontend. If you want the API repository, access: https://github.com/LionsWrath/invisum-api


We are getting started, so developers and users willing to test our platform are welcome.
